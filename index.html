	<h2>Anhur, Slayer of Enemies</h2>
	<p><strong>In Egyptian lore, Anhur can be found at the head of any charge, crushing corruption and leading the people to freedom.</strong> While his spear is deadly, the Slayer of Enemies is also cunning and clever, able to outmaneuver opponents in ways they least expect. As a physical assassin in the MOBA game Smite, the lion-headed Egyptian god of war slays his enemies with spear and guile! </p>

	<h2><a id="lore">Lore</a></h2>
	<p><strong>As a son of Ra, Anhur, and his sister Bastet, rode in the golden barge their father sailed across the sky each day.</strong> They protected the ship at dawn and dusk from the world serpent, Apep, who lurked at the horizon. Courageous, formidable, and above all, intelligent, Anhur defended the vessel with his spear and wits, outsmarting and distracting the serpent until feral Bastet delivered a killing blow. With Apep gone, Ra became Pharaoh, Bastet, the Goddess of Cats and Women, and Anhur donned the mantle of the god of war. This is how he became known as the Slayer of Enemies.
	
	As time went on, another feline Goddess, Menhet, ran away from the pantheon, spurning Ra. Anhur vowed to bring her back from the distant lands of Nubia to appease his father, but when he finally caught up with Menhet, he was enraptured and fell in love. He tied a rope to her neck and led her home, where he requested Menhet become his wife, a boon Ra happily granted.</p>

	<h2><a id="role">Role</a></h2>
	<p><strong>On the <a href="http://smitegame.com" target="_blank">Smite</a> battlefield, Anhur is a ranged physical assassin.</strong> He uses his leaping skill Disperse as a means to initiate fights with low health opponents or to escape danger. His combination skills of Obelisk and Impale can dispatch enemies who might typically escape with a leaping or dashing skill. His ultimate skill, Desert Fury, assits him in applying very direct pressure to enemy teams.</p>
